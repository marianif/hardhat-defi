# Hardhat Defi Project

This program allows to interact with a popular de-fi protocol: AAVE.

Our code allows user to:

- Deposit a collateral
- Borrow another asset
- Repay the borrowed asset

Other important topics:

By now we made test on our smartcontracts by using mocks. There is another way to make tests and it's forking the mainnet. In this program we will opt for this second option. Thank's to the hardhat framework we can do this in few lines of code in our hardhat.config.js file.
